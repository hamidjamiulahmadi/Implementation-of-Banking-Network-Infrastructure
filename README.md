<h1>Implementation of Banking Network Infrastructure</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<br />In this lab, I will design a network comprising four floors, with each floor containing three departments. Each department will be equipped with its own devices, and the networks of each department will be isolated to ensure data security. The objective of this project is to enable seamless communication between all devices.
<br />
To achieve this, I will utilize four routers, one for each floor, and deploy four Layer3 switches per floor. Each Layer3 switch will be interconnected with the corresponding routers and three Layer2 switches for each floor. Additional details are provided in the accompanying diagram..

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Packet Tracer</b> 
- <b>Windows 11</b>

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>
Step Nr.1: The initial step involves creating a network diagram to provide a clearer understanding of the process and illustrate the methodology to be employed.
